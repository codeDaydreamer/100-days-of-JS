### Thoughts : 
Javascript seems Interesting to learn. I'm positive my skills will grow significantly over the next few weeks. 

## Day 2: March 12,2024
### Today's progress :
Today i learnt how to accept user input in javascript by means of a textbox and a window prompt.
i converted datatypes from one form to another and also tackled arithmetic operators.
### Thoughts : 
So far,everythings working perfectly.

## Day 3: March 13,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I did something fun,i created a simple dice gameðŸŽ®!. I also learnt of the JS-Math object and used it to create a counter program.
I used HTML to create the game stracture and CSS to style the UI.
### Thoughts : 
Coding can be fun ,no its funðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜‚

## Day 4: March 14,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I created a simple discount and payment-option checker for a site using IF and Case statements in Javascript. i'm now comfortable with the IF statements and the Case, which is more suited for various conditions than the IF statementðŸ˜Œ.
### Thoughts : 
Coding is like creating art.You first have to visualize what you want to create then use the brush and canvas to bring your design to lifeðŸŽ¨.

## Day 5: March 15,2024
### Today's progress :
Today i learnt about the various string methods and techniques in javascript.
### Thoughts : 
Not sure yet where i will use these methods but,seeing as they're in the syllabus,why not ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Day 6: March 16,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I learnt about the method-chaining feature in JS. Its really good as it saves space interms of lines of code written.
### Thoughts : 
Seems like even coding has some cheatcodes here n there.

## Day 7: March 17,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I learnt of the equality and the strict equality operator. I also learnt of the strict inequality operator which is the inverse.
### Thoughts :
A single sign in JS could change the entire logic,

## Day 8: March 18,2024
### Today's progress :
I got to learn the FOR and While loops in JS. I learnt how to break from one and how to skip an iteration if a certain condition is met.

### Thoughts :
These loops will come in handy soon.

# Day 9: March 19,2024
### Today's progress :
I got to learn how functions are defined and called in JS. I learnt how they are used to manage the functionality of HTML components such as buttons.

### Thoughts :
Functions save time since the logic is only defined once and can be called from other areas within the code. This prevents repeating code.
### Just a BTW;
Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide information hiding. That is, objects cannot have private variables and private methods: All members are public.

But it turns out that JavaScript objects can have private variables and private methods.Of course, few understand this because JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language.

Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide inheritance. But it turns out that JavaScript supports not only classical inheritance, but other code reuse patterns as well.,I would say it has capabilities to seem OO.ðŸ˜…ðŸŒš

# Day 10: March 20,2024
### Today's progress :
I created temperature unit-converter using HTML,CSS and JS.
### Thoughts :
10 days down the line ,the future still seems promising.

# Day 11: March 21,2024
### Today's progress :
Had an introduction to arrays in javascript.
### Thoughts :
its getting more real.

# Day 12: March 22,2024
### Today's progress :
Took a much deeper dive into arrays in javascript.
### Thoughts :
Happy hacking ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥‚

# Day 13: March 23,2024
### Today's progress :
Still in Arrays. Used my knowledge in functions and arrays to come up with a simple program to add and manage members of an organisation.
### Thoughts :
There are those days that you just have to put an extra gear so as to get enough power. ðŸ’¥
