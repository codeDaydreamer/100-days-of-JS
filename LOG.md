## Day 4: March 13,2024
### Today's progress :
Today i created a simple discount and payment-option checker for a site using IF and Case statements in Javascriot. i'm now comfortable with the IF statements and the Case which is more suited for various conditions than the IF statement.
### Thoughts : 
Coding is like creating art.You first have to visualize what you want to create then use the brush and canvas to bring your design to life.
