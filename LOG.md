## Day 4: March 14,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I created a simple discount and payment-option checker for a site using IF and Case statements in Javascript. i'm now comfortable with the IF statements and the Case, which is more suited for various conditions than the IF statement😌.
### Thoughts : 
Coding is like creating art.You first have to visualize what you want to create then use the brush and canvas to bring your design to life🎨.

## Day 5: March 15,2024
### Today's progress :
Today i learnt about the various string methods and techniques in javascript.
### Thoughts : 
Not sure yet where i will use these methods but,seeing as they're in the syllabus,why not 😂😂

## Day 6: March 16,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I learnt about the method-chaining feature in JS. Its really good as it saves space interms of lines of code written.
### Thoughts : 
Seems like even coding has some cheatcodes here n there.

## Day 7: March 17,2024
### Today's progress :
Today I learnt of the equality and the strict equality operator. I also learnt of the strict inequality operator which is the inverse.
### Thoughts :
A single sign in JS could change the entire logic,

## Day 8: March 18,2024
### Today's progress :
I got to learn the FOR and While loops in JS. I learnt how to break from one and how to skip an iteration if a certain condition is met.

### Thoughts :
These loops will come in handy soon.

# Day 9: March 19,2024
### Today's progress :
I got to learn how functions are defined and called in JS. I learnt how they are used to manage the functionality of HTML components such as buttons.

### Thoughts :
Functions save time since the logic is only defined once and can be called from other areas within the code. This prevents repeating code.
### Just a BTW;
Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide information hiding. That is, objects cannot have private variables and private methods: All members are public.

But it turns out that JavaScript objects can have private variables and private methods.Of course, few understand this because JavaScript is the world's most misunderstood programming language.

Some argue that JavaScript is not truly object oriented because it does not provide inheritance. But it turns out that JavaScript supports not only classical inheritance, but other code reuse patterns as well.,I would say it has capabilities to seem OO.😅🌚
