# 100 Days of JavaScript Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of JavaScript Code Challenge** repository! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository documents my journey as I embark on a 100-day coding challenge to master JavaScript. Each day, I'll be committing myself to learning, practicing, and applying JavaScript concepts through coding exercises, projects, and challenges.

## Motivation
As someone passionate about technology and eager to advance my skills, I'm thrilled to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and become a proficient developer.

## Structure
In this repository, you'll find:

- **Daily Logs**: A log of my daily progress, including the tasks completed, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
- **Projects**: Any projects or mini-applications built during the challenge.
- **Resources**: Useful tutorials, articles, and references that I find helpful along the way.

## Goals
My primary goals for this challenge are:

- **Master JavaScript Fundamentals**: Build a solid foundation in core JavaScript concepts like variables, data types, functions, arrays, objects, and control flow.
- **Explore Advanced Topics**: Dive deeper into advanced JavaScript topics such as ES6 features, asynchronous programming, functional programming, and more.
- **Build Real-World Projects**: Apply my learning by building practical projects that showcase my skills and creativity.
- **Consistent Learning Habits**: Develop a habit of consistent learning and coding practice, even on busy days.

## Progress
You can track my progress and follow along with the challenge through the [Daily Logs](https://github.com/codeDaydreamer/100-days-of-JS/blob/main/LOG.md) section.
